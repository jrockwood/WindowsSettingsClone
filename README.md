# Windows Settings Clone

> A clone of the Windows Settings app (also known as the Immersive Control Panel) for learning purposes

I wanted to learn more about how to develop a UWP (Universal Windows Platform) application, so as I'm wont to do, I pick
an app that highlights all of the features of the target framework/platform and try to reproduce it exactly. In this
case, I picked the Windows Settings app since it showcases all of the latest Windows UI and platform features.

## Design

The design and architecture of the code is documented in [docs/Design.md](docs/Design.md).
